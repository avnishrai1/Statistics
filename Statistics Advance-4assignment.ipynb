    "Bayes’ Theorem is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes. It is a very important theorem in mathematics that is used to find the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to that event. It is a further case of conditional probability. For example, There are 3 bags, each containing some white marble and some black marble in each bag. If a white marble is drawn at random. What is the probability to find that this white marble is from the first bag? In cases like such, we use Bayes’ Theorem. It is used where the probability of occurrence of a particular event is calculated based on other conditions which are also called conditional probability.\n",
