    "    Descriptive Statistics: This branch involves methods for summarizing and describing data. It includes measures such as mean (average), \n",
    "    edian (middle value), mode (most frequent value), standard deviation (a measure of data spread), and various graphical representations \n",
    "    like histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots. Descriptive statistics help in presenting data in a clear and understandable manner.\n",
    "    Example: In a survey of students' ages in a classroom, you calculate the mean (average) age, the median (middle age), and the range \n",
    "    (difference between the maximum and minimum ages) to describe the age distribution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics deals with making predictions, inferences, or generalizations about a population based \n",
    "    on a sample of data. It includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and more advanced techniques. \n",
    "    Inferential statistics are used to draw conclusions about a larger group (population) from a smaller subset (sample) of data.\n",

    "    Descriptive statistics are used to summarize, organize, and present data in a meaningful and concise way. They provide a clear and \n",

    "    \n",
    "    Median (Middle Value):\n",
    "    The median is the middle value when the data is ordered from smallest to largest (or vice versa). If there is an even number of data \n",
    "    points, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Mode (Most Frequent Value):\n",
    "    The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "    Use: The mode is used to identify the most common value(s) in a dataset. It is particularly useful for categorical data.\n",

    "    Range:\n",
    "    The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Variance:\n",
    "    Variance measures how much each data point differs from the mean. It is calculated by averaging the squared differences between each\n",

    "    Use: Variance quantifies the overall variability in the data. A higher variance indicates greater data dispersion.\n",

    "    Standard Deviation:\n",
    "    the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average distance between each data point and the mean.\n",

    "    Interquartile Range (IQR):\n",
    "    The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the data when it is sorted. It measures the spread \n",
